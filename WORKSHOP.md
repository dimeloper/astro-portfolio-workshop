## Web Vitals review

### Prerequisites for the Web Vitals analysis

- Install Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/

### Core Web Vitals Examples

- Bad example: https://ng-pokedex-optimization.netlify.app/pokedex-bad
- Good example: https://ng-pokedex-optimization.netlify.app/pokedex-optimized

To detect the LCP element in our webpage we can use the performance section of
our Chrome dev tools as such:

## Building our own portfolio page

### Prerequisites for the coding part

- Install GIT
    - Mac: `brew install git`
    - Linux: `sudo apt-get install git`
    - Windows: Download installer from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Install Node and NPM
    - Mac: `brew install node`
    - Linux: `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
    - Windows: Download .msi installer from: https://nodejs.org/en/download

You can verify that the required tools are available by opening a new terminal and checking
their versions: `git --version`, `nodejs -v` and `npm -v`.

### Kick off a new Astro project

`npm create astro@latest`

Choose your project name, include Typescript, initialise a Git repository.

### Running the project locally

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Using the built-in astro image component

Loading images in astro is fairly simple and if they are kept in `src/` Astro will transform, optimize and bundle them.
If you want to disable the default optimization place your images in the `/public` directory.

```javascript
import treeImage from '../assets/images/tree-banner.webp';
```

```html

<Image src={treeImage} alt="Banner" />
```

#### LCP image

By default, Astro will lazy load our images, therefore in case our LCP element is an image we need to mark it as eager.

```html

<Image src={lcpImage} loading="eager" alt="LCP-Banner" />
```

### Add astro-icon in order to gain access to svg icons

Go into the project directory and run:
`npm run astro add astro-icon`

This will include the Icon library configuration into our project.
Then we will also need to add an icon set, in our case the Material Design Icons:
`npm install @iconify-json/mdi`

Now we can use icons as such:

```html

<Icon class="astro-icon" name="mdi:emoticon-outline" />
```

### Adding a react/svelte/vue component

In case we need to build an interactive component using a framework we know better, we can use the integrations Astro
provides us with. See [related documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/)

For example if we want to include a React component we can do it as such:

```shell
npm run astro add react
```

Astro will take care of all the configuration adjustments,
we only need to create our component and simply import it in
the template.

```javascript
import ReactRegisterForm from '../components-react/ReactComponents/ReactForm';
```

```html

<ReactComponent />
```

By default, Astro will automatically render every UI component to just HTML & CSS, stripping out all client-side
JavaScript automatically.

Turning any static UI component into an interactive island requires only a client:* directive. Astro then automatically
builds and bundles your client-side JavaScript for optimized performance.

```html

<ReactComponent client:load />
```

### Deploying our page on Netlify

Finally, we are going to deploy our site via netlify.
First we will add the related astro integration:

```shell
npm run astro add netlify
```

Then we will go to the [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com), login with our github account
and create a new deployment based on our portfolio repository.

Voila! Our portfolio is now deployed and whenever we push a commit to main the latest version will automatically get
deployed too.
